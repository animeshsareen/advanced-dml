## A collection of SQL scripts using advanced DML syntax

Run [this DDL script](https://github.com/animeshsareen/registration-sql/files/10147123/ddl.script.txt) to practice + test your own queries. You can see how we arrived at that relational database design over in [this](https://github.com/animeshsareen/registration-database) repo.

- Don't forget that my scripts were written in Oracle, so they may not be the same as yours.

In that case, check out [this website](http://www.sqlines.com/online) to convert between any two query languages.

Run [this](https://github.com/animeshsareen/advanced-dml/blob/main/ddl-script.sql) Oracle SQL script to initialize the student registration database!

*Beware of the first PL/SQL block -* **it drops all user-objects.**

### Introducing SELECT, JOIN, and Subqueries

``` SQL 
--Starting with some basic SELECT queries
-- Read the syntax and predict what the output might be!

-- working with functions in SELECT
SELECT
    COUNT(*)  AS count_of_student,
    MIN(cgpa) AS min_student_cgpa,
    MAX(cgpa) AS max_student_cgpa
FROM
    student;
    
--using JOINs with aliases
SELECT

    c.course_code,
    COUNT(sc.section_id) AS number_of_classes

    AND substr(c.course_code, 1, 3) IN ( 'ACC', 'MIS' )
GROUP BY
    t.last_name,
    c.course_code
ORDER BY
    1,
    2;

/* 
This is a decently advanced query, since it uses aggregate functions (AVG)
To execute it, we did a multi-join and used GROUP BY to ensure SQL knew what to aggregate by
*/

/* 

ROLLUP vs CUBE: what's the difference?

CUBE returns subtotals for all column permutations, while rollup 
only computes hierarchical subtotals as we "rollup" into a grand sum (ex. city -> zip); 

CUBE is often useful in business contexts (ex. analyzing global iPhone sales) 
since it'll show crosstabular subtotals across dimensions 
â€”  i.e. city, country, model, AND city + country, city + model, country + model... so on.
