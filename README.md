Run [this DDL script](https://github.com/animeshsareen/registration-sql/files/10147123/ddl.script.txt) to practice + test your own queries.

- Don't forget that my scripts were written in Oracle
- it's likely not the same as your RDBMS.

In that case, check out [this website](http://www.sqlines.com/online) to convert between any two query languages.
